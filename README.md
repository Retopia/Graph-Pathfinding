# Graph-Pathfinding
![Project View](https://i.imgur.com/LcRPMzq.png)
In my Junior year of High School, I took a class called Honors Artificial Intelligence, this project is one of 20 projects that I created for this class.

For this project, I went a little bit extra and created a 3D world using Perlin Noise and added beacons (predefined location) that acted as the nodes for the graph, when all we had to do with make a 2D application with a graph.

Types of pathfinding available in this projects:
* Uniform Cost Search
* Greedy Search
* A* Search

## How to Use
Use arrow keys, PgUp and PgDown to control the camera. Press set target to start the pathfinding process (there will be a bunch of popups that will guide you through the process). Each of the beacon is selectable, and can be done so by hovering over it (showing its name and location).
